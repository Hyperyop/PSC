## This project has 2 parts:
### The first part is an orientation detector class. To use this class you need a pretrained keras model this can be achieved by running the Transfer_learning_algorithm_2.py python script. You then need to initialise the class with the path to the saved model and then you can call it on a instance of PIL Image.
### The second part is an ellipse detector under the file canny.py. Please refer to the relevant markdown file for how-to-use.
